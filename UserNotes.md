This will be our main hub for keyboard shortcuts, customizations, or any other
things that need to be remembered if we havent used them in a long time.


## Keyboard Shortcuts

### YABAI
Mouse Settings:
- option + click/drag left mouse btn:
    - If you hold down the option key and use the mouse, you can click and drag an
    application from anywhere in the window and drop it onto another application.
- option + click/drag right mouse btn:
    - If you hold down the option key and use the right mouse button, you can resize
    without having to make sure you are right at the edge of a window.
- Drop a window onto another to swap them.  Can be done with our without the
  option key, however, the option key makes it significantly easier to do.

You can disable Yabai from using specific apps by adding them to the ignore list
in the rc file.
