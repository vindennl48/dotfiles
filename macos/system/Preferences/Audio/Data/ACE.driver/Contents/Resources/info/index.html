<p>To install ACE, just follow the prompts. Enter your password when requested, and you should be all set.</p>

<p>The ACE components will be placed in the /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/ folder.</p>

<h3>Uninstalling</h3>
<p>To uninstall ACE, choose the “Uninstall” option within an application that uses ACE.</p>

<h3>Version History</h3>

<h4>11.9.2</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>A regression where audio capture became unreliable on MacOS 13.1 has been fixed. [#3814, #3821]</p></li>						
</ul>	





<h4>11.9.1</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>Additional logging has been added, to help isolate issues with authorization status. [#3731]</p></li>						

	<li><p>Unnecessary processing on device change events has been removed, to help avoid issues with configuration updates. [#3732]</p></li>						

	<li><p>ACE now better detects and tolerates instances where the user has improperly disabled the ACE background items.</p></li>						
</ul>	





<h4>11.9.0</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>ACE is now compatible with MacOS 13 (Ventura). [#2567, #3653, #3671]</p></li>						

	<li><p>Meters have been fixed to prevent incorrectly reporting invalid levels when their target device’s sample rate changes. [#3487]</p></li>						

	<li><p>Channel selection for VOIP audio captures has been improved, to isolate input vs output. [#3539]</p></li>						
</ul>	





<h4>11.8.3</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>Additional corrections have been made to avoid triggering an improper Control Center mic-in-use notice on MacOS 12 (Monterey).</p></li>	

</ul>	





<h4>11.8.2</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>A memory leak caused by the Meter CPU optimization in 11.8.1 has been fixed.</p></li>

</ul>	





<h4>11.8.1</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>Meters with only one app or device context have been optimized to use very little CPU. [#3347]</p></li>					

	<li><p>The overhead of resampling and drift correction initialization has been greatly reduced. [#3346]</p></li>

	<li><p>Fixed a rare audio quality issue that could affect SoundSource when audio buffers where larger than 2048 frames and sample rates were lower than 88.2kHz. [#3304]</p></li>

	<li><p>The setup and teardown of taps has been optimized, and now ignores clock re-sync.</p></li>

	<li><p>Tap processing timeouts have been increased to four time the expected IO cycle duration<./p></li>

	<li><p>Similarly, tap pre-flight timeouts have been greatly increased to work better with plugins that take a long time to initialize and/or start.</p></li>

	<li><p>An inconsistency in the Tap API has been corrected. This resolves an issue with SoundSource where it could hang after a coreaudiod restart.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Device tracking has been improved yet again, working around issues with multi-function USB devices (including those from Realtek) that present differently based on what is connected to them.</p></li>

	<li><p>Excessive logging about potential IO cycle timing violations has been toned down. Desired logging for actual violations is still present.</p></li>

</ul>	




<h4>11.8.0</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>Volume will now be received at the correct volume recording from the built-in microphone while it’s used by FaceTime, working around an Apple bug. [#2734]</p></li>							

	<li><p>Poorly implemented AudioUnits will no longer block audio playback, thanks to timeouts in the tap preflight and process callbacks used by SoundSource. [#2888)]</p></li>							
	
	<li><p>Tracking of audio device sample clocks now works better when presented with erroneous information. [#2894]</p></li>

	<li><p>Audio capture is now more robust, even when devices (usually Bluetooth) disconnect and reconnect frequently. [#2748]</p></li>								
	
	<li><p>A a very rare coreaudiod crash / hang that could occur if an application crashed immediately after starting to play audio has been fixed. [#2584]</p></li>							

	<li><p>An audio sync / glitching issue that could occur if a device clock rate changed significantly soon after starting to play audio has been fixed. [#2429, #2624]</p></li>							
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><p>A workaround for an incompatibility with MacOS 11.3 has been implemented.</p></li>						

	<li><p>Rare audio glitches, caused by large 4K buffers and major sample rate differences (e.g. 44.1 kHz to 192 kHz) will no longer occur. [#1490]</p></li>

	<li><p>ACE now does more to allow the Mac to sleep when running MacOS 11 (Big Sur). [#1524]</p></li>

</ul>





<h4>11.5.1</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>Audio will no longer become distorted after a SoundSource redirect or Loopback monitor is used for a prolonged period of time, nor when a Loopback device was included in an aggregate device. [#1378, #1382]</p></li>						
	<li><p> Loopback pass-thru audio is no longer drift corrected, and its latency is now more consistent. [#1382]</p></li>		
	<li><p>Performance has been improved, to minimize the chance of CPU overloads when audio playback or recording is initially started. This fixes some undesired behavior when working alongside Pro Tools. [#1376]</p></li>	
	<li><p>A race condition which could occur when audio playback or recording was stopped has been fixed. This avoids issues with future audio playback or recording failing, and fixes another Pro Tools incompatibility. [#1376, #1381]</p></li>	
	<li><p>An issue where the newest versions of ACE could cause problems with the old SoundSource 4 has been fixed. [#1366]</p></li>

</ul>

<h4>8.0.6</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>An issue where a crash of instanton-agent could occur on Mac OS X 10.7 has been corrected. The crash was largely harmless, but also entirely needless.</p></li>

<ul>
	<li><p>Instant On has been updated for improved support for Fast User Switching, limiting audio captures to the sessions in which they are initiated.</p></li>
	<li><p>Audio artifacts could occur under heavy CPU load or VM paging. Instant On improves on this, and these already-rare dropouts should now be much more rare. This should also fix issues with static crackles creeping in on long audio captures, which could eventually result in a loss of playback audio all together.</p></li>
