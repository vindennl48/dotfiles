# Brainstorm for custom program

## Desires
- A way to flip a symlink between the link and the actual file/folder
- Making the computer ignore sleep or allow sleep

## Code Platform
- Should this be all bash based? Will definitely be harder to code but easier
  to use without having to keep track of python versions
